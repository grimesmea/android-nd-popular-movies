# android-nd-popular-movies
Android app developed as part of Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree program allowing users to explore popular movies using data fetched from The Movie Database (TMDb) API.

This product uses the TMDb API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb.

#TMDb API Key Insertion
In order for the app to query the TMDb API, a personal API key will need to be obtained by creating a TMDb account (https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup) and requesting an API key.

Once obtained, the following line will need to be added to the local.properties file for project:
    API_KEY=[YOUR API KEY HERE]
